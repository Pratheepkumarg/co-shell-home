            <h1>Sustainable Product Development for Coconut Shell Products</h1>

            <p>Coconut shells, often considered waste, present a valuable opportunity for sustainable product
                development. By repurposing coconut shells into various products, we contribute to environmental
                conservation and create eco-friendly alternatives. Here's how we approach sustainable product
                development:</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <div class="eco">
                <h2> Material Sourcing</h2>
                <img src="C:\Users\VT\Desktop\pkweb\images\VNM0560.jpg" width="800" height="500"
                    style="border-radius: 20px; border-color: #d8d5d58d; border-style:outset;border-width:5px;">
                <p>We carefully select coconut shells from sustainable sources, ensuring minimal environmental impact.
                    This ethical approach supports local communities involved in the coconut industry.</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\VT\Desktop\pkweb\images\pro-7937283723.jpg" width="800" height="500"
                    style=" border-radius:20px; border-color: #d8d5d58d; border-style:outset;border-width:5px;">
                <p>The coconuts collected are of different sizes. A mature coconut is chosen because it is lignin,
                    eliminating any chances of germs breeding. The kernel part is removed and is cleaned to get the
                    shell.

                    The shell is sanded several times to get a smooth finish. After they are sanded, the shells are cut
                    into desired shapes and sizes with the help of a coping saw. The design is marked with a marker and
                    then the coping saw is used to create designs on the coconut shell. </p>
                <h2></h2> Design Innovation</h2>

                <p>Our design process focuses on creating functional and aesthetically pleasing products from coconut
                    shells. We explore the versatility of the material to produce items ranging from kitchenware to
                    decorative pieces.</p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <div class="eco">
            <h2>Environmental Impact Assessment</h2>
            <p>Before introducing a new product, we conduct thorough assessments to understand its environmental impact.
                This includes considering the entire lifecycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal.
            </p>

            <p>Sustainable living is by no means easy. As we’ve gotten used to purchasing plastic items and other
                products made from artificial chemicals, it tends to be difficult to live a life without these
                purchases. However, there’s one way to make living sustainably easier, and it starts with choosing
                sustainable products, just like coconut bowls. <br>By surrounding yourself with sustainable choices, you
                can transform your environment into a more sustainable.
                This results in a change of your identity and, in turn, your lifestyle.<br> That is because your
                environment can influence the decisions you make and the habits you create.<br><b>when your home
                    environment is filled with eco-friendly products like coconut bowls,
                    you can be a lot more motivated to live a totally eco-friendly and sustainable lifestyle.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Educational workshops and awareness campaigns for coconut shell products play a crucial role in
                    promoting sustainability, environmental consciousness, and the utilization of natural resources.
                    These initiatives aim to enlighten individuals about the numerous possibilities that arise from
                    repurposing coconut shells, turning what might be considered waste into valuable and eco-friendly
                    commodities.</li>
                <li>Workshops provide a hands-on experience, demonstrating the diverse applications of coconut shells,

                    of resorting to conventional materials.</li>
                <li>Awareness campaigns complement these workshops by disseminating information on the environmental
                    impact of waste, specifically highlighting the issues related to non-biodegradable materials. By
                    showcasing the versatility of coconut shells, these campaigns inspire individuals to make conscious

                <li>Furthermore, these workshops and campaigns shed light on the economic opportunities linked to the
                    coconut industry. By encouraging the production and sale of coconut shell products, local
                    communities can benefit economically while simultaneously promoting environmentally friendly
                    practices.</li>
